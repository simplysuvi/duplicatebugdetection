       "      <td>the find toolbar was recently given its own stylesheet in global but the close button lost the .tabsclosebutton class i assume because it was only defined in browserbrowser.css.  that class is still useful on that button for defining the source image and hover and active states which are the same for the tab bar side bar message bars and find toolbar.  the only things that change are borders and padding which are easily handled on a percase basis by using ids.  if the .tabsclosebutton is moved to globaltoolbarbutton.css then it can be picked up anywhere it needs to be used.  so the two things im asking for . move the basic styles to global . return the .tabsclosebutton class to findclosebutton and use it on any other close buttons in the future.  ill be honest and admit that part of why im requesting this is because it needlessly breaks my theme.  but its also just a logical more efficient and consistent use of code.  patch on the way...</td>\n",
